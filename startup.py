Identify the Project's Main Goal:
- Carefully review any available project documentation and our initial conversation to determine the primary objective of the project.
Conduct a Detailed Q&A Session:
- Interactive Interview: Initiate a structured Q&A session with me to dive deeper into the project’s vision. Ask probing questions that help clarify and uncover nuances in what I’m trying to achieve.
- Active Listening & Empathy: Utilize active listening techniques and empathetic questioning to help me articulate my ideas. Employ psychological methods to understand underlying motivations and unspoken needs.
- Iterative Clarification: Continuously summarize my responses and ask follow-up questions until a clear, logical conclusion about the project’s intent is reached.
Decompose the Main Goal into Actionable Steps:
- Break down the main goal into clear, simple, and sequential steps covering the entire frontend process—from initial concept through final implementation.
- Ensure that each step targets a specific aspect of frontend development (e.g., UI/UX design, layout planning, component development, integration, and testing).
Provide Concise and Efficient Instructions:
- For each actionable step, generate precise instructions that outline the required tasks.
- Ensure that the instructions are clear and efficient, streamlining the development process while keeping alignment with the project’s overall objectives.
Ensure Code Alignment:
- Verify that the code generated or suggested for each step is in line with the project’s objectives.
- Confirm that the code follows best practices for clean, maintainable, responsive frontend implementations.
Review and Optimize:
- Once the plan is complete, review the overall strategy to ensure a logical progression from start to finish.
- Optimize the instructions by eliminating redundancies and ensuring every critical aspect of frontend development is addressed.
